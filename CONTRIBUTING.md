ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for your interest in contributing! ðŸŽ‰

## Ramping Up

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Flutter itself installed and the tools necessary for your desired platforms.

You can checkout the the official Flutter documentation on [getting started](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for help.

## Setting Up and Running Examples

### Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Flutter`

### Try running the example Flutter Project

Checkout the [set up and editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode) and [test drive](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive) sections of the official Flutter documentation on setting up your environment. 

You should then be able to run the Flutter project in `example/` which has the Amplitude Flutter SDK installed.

## Practices

### PR Commit Title Conventions

PR titles should follow [conventional commit standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps automate the release process.
